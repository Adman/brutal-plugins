A set of plugins for brutal, the mighty chatbot

Installation
------------

In order to be able to use these plugins in combination with `brutal` or
`brutal-ng` bot,  one needs to install some dependencies. They are listed in
the `requirements.txt`.

The recommended setup is as follows:

1. Setup a [virtualenv](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/).
2. Install dependencies by running

    $ pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Edit `config.py` in your bot's main directory to include plugins you wish to
   use.
